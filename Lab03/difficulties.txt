One difficulty that I encountered was to figure out how the push method would work. At the beginning, I have no idea how to add a stacknode into an empty stack. What I did to solve this problem is to create a topnode t, then i make it to point to the pushelement. 

The other difficulty was the pop method. I was not sure how to delete the top element. Then i realized that I just needed to make the topnode point to the element under the top. I don't really need to delete the top one.
